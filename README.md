# aws-setup

## Summary
This project covers the setup of a new AWS account for learning and development. I created an IAM user, set up a budget with alerts, and explored the basics of DynamoDB.

## DynamoDB Insight
I learned that DynamoDB provides low-latency responses and scales automatically without manual intervention. It's great for serverless and real-time applications.

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It delivers high performance at scale, offering single-digit millisecond response times for both read and write operations.

DynamoDB is commonly used for:

Real-time applications (e.g. gaming, chat apps)

Shopping carts and user sessions

Serverless backends

IoT and device data tracking

Mobile and web apps needing fast access to data
